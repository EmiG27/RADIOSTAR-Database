#TODO: This one should do the magic, and be as simple as it can.

# 0. import files from the utils folder
# data_reader.py
# data_processer.py
# data_plotter.py

# 1. read the data 
# 1.1 grab inputfiles' paths from command line ? - though this could be implemented later
# usage could be something like this: 
# plot.py -i input_file.txt -d data_file.txt -r rerence_file.txt
# -r could be optional (maybe? I guess it's not changes much)
# 1.2 read the data
# input = read_input(input_file)
# data = read_data(data_file)
# reference = read_reference(reference_file)


# 2. process the data for the plots
# data_to_plot = process(input,data,reference)


# 3. plot the data
# plot(processed_data,input) 


# that's should be all.
